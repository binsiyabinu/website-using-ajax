      <h1>Hagia Sophia History</h1>
<p>Unable to repair the damage caused by the fire, Justinian ordered the demolition
  of the Hagia Sophia in 532. He commissioned renowned architects Isidoros (Milet)
  and Anthemios (Tralles) to build a new basilica.

The third Hagia Sophia was completed in 537, and it remains standing today.

The first religious services in the “new” Hagia Sophia were held on December 27, 537.
 At the time, Emperor Justinian is reported to have said, “My Lord, thank you for
  giving me the chance to create such a worshipping place.”</p>
